## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a production-ready DevSecOps pipeline built for **NexusCore Technologies**, a Series A fintech startup processing $2M in daily transactions. The pipeline implements automated security scanning at every stage of the development lifecycle.

### Business Context
- **Client**: NexusCore Technologies (Fintech - Payment Processing)
- **Challenge**: 3 security incidents in Q4, investors demanding improved security posture
- **Solution**: Shift-left security approach with automated scanning in CI/CD

## Security Tools Implemented

| Tool | Purpose | Stage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **CodeQL** | Static Application Security Testing (SAST) | Build |
| **Trivy** | Dependency & Container Scanning (SCA) | Build |
| **Gitleaks** | Secret Detection | Pre-commit |
| **Trivy IaC** | Infrastructure as Code Security | Build |

## Architecture

\`\`\`
Developer Push --> GitHub Actions --> Security Scans --> Docker Build --> AWS Deployment
                        |
                        ├── SAST (CodeQL)
                        ├── SCA (Trivy)
                        ├── Secret Scan (Gitleaks)
                        └── IaC Scan (Trivy)
\`\`\`

## Security Findings

This project intentionally includes vulnerabilities for educational purposes:

### SAST Findings (CodeQL)
- SQL Injection in user lookup function
- Command Injection in ping endpoint
- Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

### SCA Findings (Trivy)
- CVE-2020-14343 in PyYAML 5.4.1 (Critical)
- Multiple vulnerabilities in Flask 2.0.1

### IaC Findings (Trivy)
- S3 bucket without encryption
- Security group with overly permissive rules

## Skills Demonstrated

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow design
- **SAST**: CodeQL query configuration
- **SCA**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Containers**: Docker security best practices
- **IaC**: Terraform with AWS
- **Secret Management**: Gitleaks configuration

## Getting Started

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyat123/Devsecops-Pipeline-Project-1.git

# The pipeline runs automatically on push
# View results in the Actions tab
